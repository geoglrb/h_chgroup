# Copy top-level annotations from one group to another

This example assumes that:

- You have a Hypothesis account
- You have edited your Hypothesis username and API token into the script
- You are a member of both groups
- You need to copy all top-level annotations from one group to another

# Why do this?

The motivation for this example: A professor has seeded a document with annotations that ask questions for students in one section of a class to answer in a Hypothesis group. Student replies accumulate in that group. Now the professor wants to restart the process for another section of the class in another Hypothesis group.
